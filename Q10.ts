/* Question 10 : 

Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, 
and add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write 
because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and 
the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing what the program does*/

// The program will do string concatenation.
let myName = "Humair";
let lastName = "Mangi";
let fullName = myName +" "+ lastName

// The program will give the type of variable 'numberGame' in output.
let numberGame = 6;
console.log(typeof(numberGame));
